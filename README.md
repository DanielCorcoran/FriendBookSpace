# FriendBookSpace
A Twitter-like alternative social media platform written in JS.  Through the app, a user can register for an account, follow or unfollow other users, post status updates, comment on statuses, and edit or delete posts.

The deployed app can be found at https://friendbookspace.herokuapp.com/

The app can also be run locally by downloading and installing node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download/, downloading the repository, opening a command prompt in the FriendBookSpace folder, and using the `npm-build` command, followed by `node app.js`.

NOTE: If run locally, MongoDB is required in order for the app to work correctly, which can be found at https://www.mongodb.com/.
